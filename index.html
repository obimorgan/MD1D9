<!-- BINGO CHALLENGE!
Create programmatically (using JS) a bingo board with 76 cells, numbered from 1 to 76.
Create a button to randomize a number from 1 to 76. The cell with same number should be highlighted in some way on the bingo board.
EXTRA: 

- Make sure to always select a new number (eg. avoid randoming the number 10 three times).

- Create a user board with 24 randomized numbers that highlights as the main board does.

- Let the user choose how many user boards he's willing to play with and generate them before starting to play. -->
